"""
Integration test: the `write` syscall (writing to real stdout, fd 1)
followed by `exit`. See tests/asm_files/syscall_write.asm.

Because `write` performs real host I/O (per assembly_specs.md, section
7 "System Calls"), the subprocess's actual stdout is asserted on
directly, rather than only checking register state.
