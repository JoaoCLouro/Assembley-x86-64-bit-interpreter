"""
Helper script run as a subprocess by the integration test suite.

This script is kept as a subprocess entry point anyway, for two reasons:
1. It's still invoked via subprocess.run() from tests/integration/conftest.py's
   run_asm fixture, so keeping this file's own behavior stable (read argv,
   print __STATE__<json>, exit 0) avoids having to touch the test fixture's
   subprocess-based interface at the same time as this interpreter interface
   change.
2. Isolation from the pytest process is still a nice safety property in
   general (e.g. if a future change reintroduces a code path that really
   does call sys.exit() unguarded), even though it's no longer strictly
   required for the exit syscall specifically.

Protocol:
    python _runner.py <asm_file_path>

On success, prints two lines to stdout:
    __EXIT_CODE__<int>
    __STATE__<json>
The first is the raw integer ExitCode returned directly by run() - kept
separate from the state dict, since it's the interpreter's own direct
run() result, not part of register/memory state. The second is
get_state("all")'s state dict. Any output the program itself wrote to
stdout (e.g. via the `write` syscall) appears before both marker lines,
since it's written during execution, prior to this script's own final
printing.
