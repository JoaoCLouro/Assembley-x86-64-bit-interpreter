class Syscall:
    """
    Resolves and executes syscalls triggered during instruction execution.
    Called from the control_unit via the `syscall()` entry point, which reads
    the syscall number and arguments straight from the register bridge, then
    dispatches to the matching handler.\n
    Handlers that move data (read/write/open/getrandom) go through the
    Data_Memory bridge to translate simulated addresses into real bytes, then
    hand those bytes to the compiled C module (libscl.so) which performs the
    actual operation. The C module has no notion of virtual addresses or
    paging — it only ever sees plain byte buffers and real fds.\n
    Syscall numbers follow the real x86-64 Linux ABI so that assembly written
    against standard syscall conventions works unmodified.
