class Data_Memory:
    """
    Helper class to manage memory allocation and access.
    Used by the Segment_Mapper to create the memory for the CPU.
    All memory addresses are relative to the memory base address.
    Provides methods to read and write data of various sizes and to perform stack operations.\n
    All memory is stored in a low-level paging system for efficiency.
    All stack operations (push/pop) are done with fixed 8-byte entries.
    Allows reading and writing of data in sizes of 1, 2, 4, or 8 bytes.
    All stack operations (push/pop) are done with fixed 8-byte entries.\n
